# Overview
VelaSuite aligns brand, licensing and security into a single metaphor:
- **Sails → Keys**: Each sail name corresponds to a capability gate (VELA.MAIN, VELA.JIB, …).
- **Rigging → Policies**: A signed **MastPolicy** turns masts/features on the device.
- **Hull (Device) → Vault**: Templates/data live locally, end-to-end encrypted.
